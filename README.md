# Shopping List CRUD App

A real-time shopping list CRUD application built with HTML, CSS, vanilla Javascript & Firebase database.

## Motivation

I wanted to learn how to build a live app that retains it's data in a database as opposed to local storage. Myself and my partner use this shopping list every week to go shopping so it is hidden behind a password. Please [reach out](https://adamdurrant.co.uk) if you'd like the password to try it out.

## Features

The app features DOM manipulation to change check boxes according to item status. Each item is created, writable, updatable and deletable using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) database.

Thank you to [Robin Moisson](https://robinmoisson.github.io/) for creating and sharing a very elegant and awesome solution to password protect a page without a server using [StatiCrypt](https://robinmoisson.github.io/staticrypt/).
